I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Valencia. I completed my PhD at the University of Zaragoza under the supervision of Pedro J. Miana and Luciano Abadías. I am also a member of the Instituto Universitario de Matemáticas y Aplicaciones. My research interests lie between $$C_0$$-semigroup theory, functional calculus, and operator theory.
