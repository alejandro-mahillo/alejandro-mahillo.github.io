In this paper, we study the end-point maximal regularity for the discrete parabolic Cauchy problem
\\[
\begin{cases}
u'(t) + Au(t) = f(t), & t > 0, \\
u(0) = 0,
\end{cases}
\\]
where $$-A$$ is the discrete Laplacian on the integers $$\mathbb{Z}$$. We consider the problem in the space $$\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$$, representing the end-point case where the classical maximal regularity fails in the continuous setting.

We introduce and characterize the discrete Besov spaces $$B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathbb{Z})$$ and prove that the operator $$A$$ admits maximal regularity in these spaces. Furthermore, we analyze the regularity properties of the fractional powers $$A^\alpha$$ and their associated non-local operators. 

Our results provide a complete picture of the mapping properties of the discrete heat semigroup in the scale of Besov spaces, generalizing previous results known for the Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^n$$.
