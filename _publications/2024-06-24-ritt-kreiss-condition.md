A new condition is introduced by generalizing the Ritt and Kreiss operators, named the $$(\alpha, \beta)$$-RK condition. Geometrical properties of the spectrum for $$\beta < 1$$ are studied; moreover, it is shown that in that case if $$\alpha + \beta = 1$$ the operator is Ritt. 

Estimates for the power and power differences norms for this type of operators are also studied. Lastly, we apply this theory to obtain an interpolation result for Ritt and Kreiss operators on $$L^p$$ spaces.
