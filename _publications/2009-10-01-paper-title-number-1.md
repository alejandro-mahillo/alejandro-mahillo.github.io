In this paper we study solutions of the quadratic equation $$AY^2 - Y + I = 0$$ where $$A$$ is the generator of a one-parameter family of operators ($$C_0$$-semigroup or cosine functions) on a Banach space $$X$$ with growth bound $$w_0 \le \tfrac{1}{4}$$.  

In the case of $$C_0$$-semigroups, we show that a solution, which we call the *Catalan generating function* of $$A$$, $$C(A)$$, is given by the Bochner integral
\\[
C(A)x := \int_0^\infty c(t) T(t)x \, \mathrm{d}t, \quad x \in X,
\\]
where $$c$$ is the Catalan kernel,
\\[
c(t) := \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{1/4}^\infty e^{-\lambda t} \frac{\sqrt{4\lambda - 1}}{\lambda} \, \mathrm{d}\lambda, \quad t > 0.
\\]

Similar (and more intricate) results hold for cosine functions.  
We study algebraic properties of the Catalan kernel $$c$$ as an element of Banach algebras $$L^1_{\omega}(\mathbb{R}^+)$$, endowed with the usual convolution product $$*$$ and with the cosine convolution product $$*_c$$.  

The Hille–Phillips functional calculus allows transferring these properties to $$C_0$$-semigroups and cosine functions.  
In particular, we obtain a spectral mapping theorem for $$C(A)$$. Finally, we present examples, applications, and conjectures to illustrate our results.
